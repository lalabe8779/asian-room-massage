If you are playing with food or oils make sure that you have a large towel handy to sit or lie on.  Perhaps you may like fragrance with oil burners and essential oils, candles, or incense sticks. Music too can play an important part so take time to choose something suitable. Turn your room into a haven of seduction and saucyness!'

        text: 'Erotic Massages can improve circulation, tone the skin and relax muscles. There is also some evidence that massage releases the bodys own endorphins or opiates and even levels of some hormones are raised through regular massage. Massage is a good way to maintain your “youth”. With a partner, erotic massage is a great way to explore and feel close. We all have responses to certain scents. Aromatherapy can evoke positive feelings and emotions. It goes hand in hand with the belief that state of mind can also help with physical problems.'

Humans, like animals, are said to give off powerful sexual scents called pheromones from their sweat glands when they are in the mood for sexual activity. These odorous chemicals work subliminally and are believed to affect the behaviour of others without their even being aware of them.'
